    "\n",
    "To run the Mosaic Tool, a set of parameters must be supplied. To simplify parameter provision, a Python dictionary is utilized as a container, capable of holding 11 “key:value” pairs (the last three are optional), each detailed as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "(1) Value for 'sensor' key: a string denoting the sensor type and data unit. Currently, valid values include 'L8_SR', 'S2_SR', 'L8_TOA' and 'S2_TOA', which denote Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and TOA reflectance data, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Value for 'year' key: a 4-digits integr representing the acquisition year (e.g., 2020) of the daily images used in compositing.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Value for 'months' key: a list of integers specifying the months of a year (e.g., [6, 7] for June and July). With a list of month numbers, multiple monthly composite images can be generated through a single execution of the Mosaic Tool. To generate a composite image for a peak season \n",
    "(June 15 to September 15) of a year (defined by the value of the 'year' key), just include a negative integer in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Value for 'tile_names' key: a set of strings representing the names of grid tiles, each covering a 900km x 900km area. Providing a list of tile names allows the creation of composite images for multiple tiles through a single execution of the Mosaic Tool. \n",
    "    To generate a composite image for a customized region, an additional \"key:value\" pair must be included in this parameter dictionary (refer to the value specification for 'custom_region' key. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Value for 'spatial_scale' key: an integer (e.g., 30 and 20 for Landsat and Sentinel-2 composites, respectively) defining the spatial resolution (in meters) for exporting resultant composite images.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Value for 'out_location' key: a string specifying the destination location for exporting resultant composite images. Valid values for this key are 'drive' or 'storage', indicating Google Drive (GD) or Google Cloud Storage (GCS), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Value for 'GCS_bucket' key: a string indicating a bucket name on GCS. This parameter is necessary only when the exporting destination is GCS ('storage' for 'out_location' key). Note that the specified bucket must exist on your GCS before exporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "(8) Value for 'out_folder' key: the folder name on GD or GCS for exporting composites. If you prefer not to export all the composites to the same directory, leave an empty string for this key. In this case, the Tool will automatically create separate folders for the composites of different tiles according to tile name and acquisition year.\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Value for 'custom_region' key: an \"ee.Geometry\" object created with the \"ee.Geometry.Polygon()\" function, taking a list of Latitude and Longitas coordinates as inputs. This 'key:value' pair is required only when a customized region has to be defined. Otherwise, DO NOT include this 'key:value' pair in parameter dictionary, as it will overwrite the values for the 'tile_names' key. \n",
    "\n",
    "(10) Value 'start_date' key: a string (e.g., '2022-06-15') for specifying the start date of a customized compositing period. \n",
    "\n",
    "(11) Value for 'end_date' key: a string (e.g., '2022-09-15') for specifying the end date of a custmoized compositing period. Please be aware that the strings for 'start_date' and 'end_date' keys should be omitted from this parameter dictionary unless a user-defined compositing period needs to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the 11 input parameters, two keys ('months' and 'tile_names') require list inputs. With different combinations between these two lists, various scenarios for composite production can be carried out. For instance, providing [7, 8] and ['tile41', 'tile42', 'tile43']) to 'months' and 'tile_names' keys, respectively, will result in the creation of three composites fo each of July and August.\n",
